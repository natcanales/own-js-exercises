    Given the following object:

        {
            address: "Calle Montañita de las Rapaces, 2",
            postalCode: "26317",
            city: "Toandsing",
            country: "Spain"
        }

    Check if the object has a property called 'alias'. If it already
    has the property, print the following message:

        "The house has an alias!"

    If it does not have the property, add the property with the value
    you want and print the following message:

        "The house does not have an alias yet!"

    Feel free to modify what you need to see both outputs.
