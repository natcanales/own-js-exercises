/*****************************************************************************

    Create an object that will represent yourself. You have to add
    the following information:

        - First name (string)
        - Last name (string)
        - Age (number)
        - If you like animals (boolean)
        - Hobbies (array)
        - Bootcamp modality (object)

    The 'bootcamp modality' field will have to contain the following
    values, (you decide the properties' names):

        - "Web Development"
        - "Full Time"

    Now that you have created the object, do not modify its declaration.
    We are going to make some changes in the data by accessing certain
    attributes:

        - Add one year to your current age
        - Change the value which says if you like animals
        - Modify your name by uppercasing it
        - Add an alias property to the 'bootcamp modality' and set
          its value to "WDFT"
        - Add two more hobbies to the array

    Finally, print the following using console.log:

        "Hi! I am <first_name> <last_name>, and I am <age> years old.
         I have <number_of_hobbies> hobbies, and now I am in Ironhack's
         Web Development - Full Time course."
    
    You obviously have to replace the information between < and >
    symbols with the information you have in your object.
