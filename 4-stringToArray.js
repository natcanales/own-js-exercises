/*****************************************************************************

    Given the string "I love you!", create an array with each
    character as element, and print it using console.log.

    Expected output:

        ["I", " ", "l", "o", "v", "e", " ", "y", "o", "u", "!"]

    HINT: you should iterate over the string to obtain each
          character, so that you can add all of them one by
          one to the result array.

    NOTE: After implementing the solution, search in Google how
          the strings' .split() method works.
