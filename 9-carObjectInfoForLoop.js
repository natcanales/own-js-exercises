/*****************************************************************************

    Given the same object as the previous exercise, use the
    'special' FOR loop to iterate over the object's keys, and
    print exactly the same content, except that now the keys must
    be completely uppercased, and we are adding a dash ('-') before
    each list element.

    Remember, the FOR loop we want to use has the following syntax:

        for (key in object) {
            // code
        }

    Expected output:

        - BRAND: KIA
        - MODEL: Rio
        - PLATE: 7548KRS
        - ALIAS: Kristine
