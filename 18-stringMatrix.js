    Write down the code to create an array of 10 empty strings using
    a loop. The array should look as the following one:

        ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]

    As you know, arrays can have other arrays as elements. Based on
    the previous code, modify it (or add more code below) to create
    an array like the following one:

        [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]

    If you pay attention, the difference between the first and the
    second array is minimal. The only real difference is that instead
    of empty strings we have now empty arrays as elements.

    Let's change the previous code to do one more thing. Instead of
    directly adding empty arrays, fill them with 10 empty strings
    (use another loop for this) before adding them to our main array.

    The result should be an array of 10 elements, and each element
    should be an array of 10 empty strings, like the following one:

        [
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
            ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]
        ]

    Well, you have now created a bidimensional array! (A.K.A. matrix).
    It might look like something you would generally not use, but it
    is really important to master nested loops :)
