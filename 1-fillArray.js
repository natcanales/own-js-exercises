/*****************************************************************************

    Create an empty array. Then fill it one by one with the following
    values:

        3, 17, 26, 20, 8, 11

    The order in which these values must appear in the array is not
    the same as the specified above. The result should be this one
    (use console.log to check if you did it correctly).

    Expected output:

        [26, 3, 17, 11, 8, 20]

    HINT: to achieve this, you have to know how to: insert an element
          at the end of the array, insert an element at the beggining
          of the array, and insert an element at any position of the
          array. Remember that you can (and should) use the arrays'
          methods that were defined for this purpose.

          You can Google anything you need :)
